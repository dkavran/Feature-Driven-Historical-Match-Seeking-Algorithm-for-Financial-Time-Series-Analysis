# Custom distance/metric helpers for KNN over second-order feature vectors.
# Logic:
# - Before computing a distance, we optionally enforce two gating conditions:
#   (1) Direction/sign alignment for every feature: np.all(np.sign(x) == np.sign(y))
#   (2) Absolute difference per second order feature <= threshold: np.all(np.abs(x - y) <= threshold)
# - If gating passes (or threshold is None), compute the requested distance.
# - If gating fails, return a large distance to indicate "no match".
